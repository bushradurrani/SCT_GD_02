For the 2nd task of my graphic design internship with SkillCraft Technology, I had the opportunity to create a logo concept for an imaginary sustainable fashion brand called The Greenstone Atelier. The idea was to design something minimalist yet reflective of the brandâ€™s eco-conscious ethos.
I wanted to fuse elements of nature with fashion, so I went with a simple hanger symbol, but added a leaf growing from it to emphasize sustainability. The earthy tones of green, beige, and black were chosen to represent natural materials and the balance between elegance and environmental responsibility.
The design process was all about keeping it modern and clean while subtly hinting at the brand's core values of sustainability. I'm excited to share this with you and would love any feedback! ðŸŒ¿âœ¨
